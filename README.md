### Notes
1. Somehow I set a break point and the simulation stopped. I thought my program was crashing. Googled it and fixed the problem
2. Forgot to set the entry point to the tab bar controller. Therefore when I simulates my program, it 's totally black without any content.
3. When I did the extra credit, somehow my backdropView is on top of my posterView. Fixed it using a built in function.

### Notes
When I first created this app, I am pretty confused about creating another cocoa file for the MovieCell, because in the lecture I created the MovieCell first, then connect the table view. After I did creating the cocoa file for multiple times, I finally understand it's funcion, even though the order of creating files in the tutoring videos in the assignment section is reversed, I know how they connect to each other.

Another problem I encountered is I have to figure out how to run the app in my iPhone. I looked it up online and they say I need to the personal team in my project, add my apple account to the Xcode, etc. However when I tried it, it rejects. After a while I figured out I need to authorize my iphone to connect to my Mac. After that, I still need to go to my iPhone's setting to allow this developer's application to run in this iPhone. After figuring out all those stuff, I finally can run my Flix app in my iPhone.
